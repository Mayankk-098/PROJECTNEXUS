Sure, Mayank! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a simple Python program that determines whether a number is odd or even:

```python
# Function to check if a number is odd or even
def check_odd_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample input
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    # Check if the number is odd or even
    result = check_odd_even(number)

    # Display the result
    print(f"The number {number} is {result}.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The `check_odd_even` function takes a single argument `number` and checks if it is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
2. **Main Program**: The program prompts the user to enter a number, then calls the `check_odd_even` function with the input number and prints the result.

You can run this code in any Python environment. It will prompt you to enter a number and then tell you whether the number is odd or even.
