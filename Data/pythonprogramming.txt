Sure! Let's start with a brief introduction to Python programming. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

### Basic Python Programming

#### Hello, World!

The traditional way to start with any programming language is to print "Hello, World!" Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

This will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

#### Variables and Data Types

Variables in Python are used to store data values. Python supports various data types like integers, floats, strings, and more.

```python
# Integer
x = 10

# Float
y = 10.5

# String
name = "Mayank"

# Boolean
is_student = True

print(x, y, name, is_student)
```

#### Basic Operations

Python supports various arithmetic operations:

```python
# Addition
sum = 5 + 3

# Subtraction
difference = 5 - 3

# Multiplication
product = 5 * 3

# Division
quotient = 5 / 3

print(sum, difference, product, quotient)
```

#### Control Structures

##### If-Else Statements

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

##### Loops

Python provides `for` and `while` loops for iteration.

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

#### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Mayank"))
```

#### List, Tuple, and Dictionary

Python supports various data structures:

```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Mayank", "age": 25}

print(fruits, coordinates, person)
```

#### Modules and Libraries

Python has a rich standard library and many third-party libraries. You can import them using the `import` statement.

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))
```

#### Example: A Simple Calculator

Here's a simple calculator program:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
    return x / y

print("Select operation:")
print("1. Add")
print("2. Subtract")
print("3. Multiply")
print("4. Divide")

choice = input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ")

num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

if choice == '1':
    print(f"The result is: {add(num1, num2)}")
elif choice == '2':
    print(f"The result is: {subtract(num1, num2)}")
elif choice == '3':
    print(f"The result is: {multiply(num1, num2)}")
elif choice == '4':
    print(f"The result is: {divide(num1, num2)}")
else:
    print("Invalid input")
```
