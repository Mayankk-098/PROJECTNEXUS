Sure, I can help you with that! To start, I need a bit more detail about the data structure project. Could you please provide the following information:

1. **Programming Language**: Which programming language are you using for the project (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.)?
2. **Data Structure**: What specific data structure are you implementing or working with (e.g., Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Graph, etc.)?
3. **Project Requirements**: Are there any specific requirements or constraints for the project?
4. **Functionality**: What functionality do you need the code to perform?
5. **Examples**: Do you have any example inputs and expected outputs?
6. **Purpose**: What is the purpose of this data structure in the context of the project?

Once I have this information, I can help you write the appropriate code for your data structure project.
