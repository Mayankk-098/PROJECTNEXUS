Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to formally request sick leave from [Start Date] to [End Date]. I have been experiencing some health issues that require me to take some time off to recover fully.

I recently visited my doctor, and he/she has advised me to rest for a few days to ensure a complete recovery. I have attached a medical certificate for your reference. I understand that my absence may cause some inconvenience and I am more than willing to make up for any missed work as soon as I am able.

During my absence, I will ensure a smooth handover of my responsibilities to [Colleague's Name]. I have also prepared a detailed report on my ongoing projects, which is attached for your reference. I will be available via email or phone for any urgent matters that may arise during my leave.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to returning to work as soon as I am able.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
