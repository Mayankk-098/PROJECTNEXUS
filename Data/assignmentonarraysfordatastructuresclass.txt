**Assignment: Introduction to Arrays in Data Structures**

**Objective:**
To understand the fundamental concepts of arrays, their properties, operations, and applications in data structures.

---

### Part 1: Theory

1. **Definition:** What is an array? Define arrays and explain their importance in data structures.
2. **Properties:**
   - **Fixed Size:** Arrays have a fixed size, determined at the time of creation.
   - **Homogeneous:** All elements in an array are of the same data type.
   - **Index-Based:** Elements in an array are accessed using an index, which starts from 0 in most programming languages.
3. **Operations:**
   - **Initialization:** How to initialize an array.
   - **Traversal:** How to traverse an array.
   - **Insertion:** How to insert an element into an array.
   - **Deletion:** How to delete an element from an array.
   - **Searching:** How to search for an element in an array.
   - **Updating:** How to update an element in an array.

### Part 2: Practical Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Array Initialization and Traversal

1. Write a program to initialize an array of 10 integers and print its elements.
2. Write a program to initialize an array of 5 floating-point numbers and print its elements.

**Example:**
```python
# Example in Python

# Initializing an array of integers
integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Printing the elements of the array
for i in integers:
    print(i)

# Initializing an array of floating-point numbers
floats = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]

# Printing the elements of the array
for f in floats:
    print(f)
```

#### Exercise 2: Array Insertion

1. Write a program to insert an element at a specific position in an array.
2. Write a program to insert an element at the end of an array.

**Example:**
```python
# Example in Python

def insert_at_position(arr, element, position):
    arr.insert(position, element)
    return arr

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Array after insertion:", insert_at_position(array, 99, 2))

def insert_end(arr, element):
    arr.append(element)
    return arr

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Array after insertion at end:", insert_end(array, 99))
```

#### Exercise 3: Array Deletion

1. Write a program to delete an element at a specific position in an array.
2. Write a program to delete the last element of an array.

**Example:**
```python
# Example in Python

def delete_at_position(arr, position):
    arr.pop(position)
    return arr

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Array after deletion:", delete_at_position(array, 2))

def delete_last(arr):
    arr.pop()
    return arr

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Array after deleting last element:", delete_last(array))
```

#### Exercise 4: Array Searching

1. Write a program to search for an element in an array using linear search.
2. Write a program to search for an element in an array using binary search (the array should be sorted).

**Example:**
```python
# Example in Python

def linear_search(arr, element):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == element:
            return i
    return -1

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Element found at index:", linear_search(array, 3))

def binary_search(arr, element):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == element:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < element:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example usage
sorted_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Element found at index:", binary_search(sorted_array, 3))
```

#### Exercise 5: Array Updating

1. Write a program to update an element at a specific position in an array.

**Example:**
```python
# Example in Python

def update_element(arr, position, new_value):
    arr[position] = new_value
    return arr

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Array after updating:", update_element(array, 2, 99))
```

### Part 3: Advanced Concepts

1. **Multi-Dimensional Arrays:** Explain what multi-dimensional arrays are and provide an example.
2. **Dynamic Arrays:** Explain the concept of dynamic arrays and how they differ from fixed-size arrays.
3. **Applications:** Discuss real-world applications of arrays in data structures and computer science.
