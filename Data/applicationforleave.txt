**Reason for Leave:**
[Briefly mention the reason for your leave. For example: I will be traveling for a personal emergency, I have a scheduled medical appointment, I am attending a family event, etc.]

I am more than willing to complete any urgent tasks before my leave or, if necessary, I can work remotely during my leave period, subject to your approval. I will ensure that my work is up to date and that there are no disruptions in the workflow.

I kindly request you to consider my application. I am committed to ensuring that my absence does not impact the team's productivity or the company's operations.
