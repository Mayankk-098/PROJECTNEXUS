**Poem: The Assignment**

In the realm where thoughts take flight,
There lies an assignment, a task in sight.
With pen in hand and mind so bright,
I conquer each problem, each riddle's plight.

Deadlines loom, but fears I'll slight,
For with each word, my knowledge grows tight.
Feedback comes, a guiding light,
In this journey of growth, both day and night.

So here's to assignments, a tool so fine,
In the tapestry of learning, a thread so divine.
