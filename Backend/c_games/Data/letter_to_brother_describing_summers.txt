I hope this letter finds you well and in high spirits. The summer has arrived, and it's a blaze of heat and sunshine here. The days are long, and the nights are warm, a stark contrast to the cool mornings we had here last winter. The city is buzzing with life, and the parks are filled with children playing and lovers walking hand in hand.

I've been trying to capture that spirit this summer. I've started playing cricket again, though I must admit, my skills have rusted a bit. I've also been trying out new recipes, something mom used to do during summers. Her special mango lassi is a hit with the neighborhood kids.

The city is hosting a summer carnival this year. There are rides, games, and a lot of food stalls. It reminds me of the village fairs we used to visit. I've been going every weekend, enjoying the simple pleasures of life.

I've also started reading more. The long days and cool evenings are perfect for losing oneself in a good book. I've just finished "To Kill a Mockingbird" and I'm currently reading "The Alchemist". I think you'd enjoy them too.

How have you been? I'd love to hear about your summer adventures. Do you have any plans for the holidays? I hope we can catch up soon. Until then, stay cool and have a great summer!

Take care,

[Your Name]
